# Morpheus API Automation Deployment Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step process for deploying the automation feature in the Morpheus API Gateway.

## Pre-Deployment Tasks

### Code Review
- Complete final code review for all automation-related components
- Verify feature flag implementation allows for quick enablement/disablement
- Ensure all PR comments have been addressed
- Confirm test coverage meets minimum 85% requirement

### Database Preparation
- Create migration script for UserAutomationSettings table
- Test migration on development database
- Prepare rollback script in case of deployment issues
- Validate indexes for query performance

### Configuration
- Create and validate model_mappings.json file
- Configure environment variables:
  - `AUTOMATION_FEATURE_ENABLED=true`
  - `DEFAULT_SESSION_EXPIRATION=3600` (or appropriate value)
  - `AUTOMATION_RETENTION_DAYS=30` (for cleanup jobs)
- Update API documentation to include automation endpoints

## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Database Migration

1. **Backup Current Database**
   ```bash
   pg_dump -U [username] -d [database] > pre_automation_backup.sql
   ```

2. **Apply Migration**
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. **Verify Migration**
   - Check that UserAutomationSettings table exists
   - Verify constraints and indexes
   - Validate permissions for API service user

### Phase 2: API Deployment

1. **Deploy API with Feature Flag Disabled**
   ```bash
   AUTOMATION_FEATURE_ENABLED=false ./deploy_api.sh
   ```

2. **Smoke Test Basic Functionality**
   - Verify API is responsive
   - Check that non-automation endpoints function correctly
   - Confirm feature flag is properly disabling automation endpoints

3. **Enable Feature for Internal Users**
   ```bash
   # Update configuration to enable for specific user IDs
   UPDATE feature_flags SET enabled_user_ids = '[list of internal IDs]' WHERE feature_name = 'automation';
   ```

4. **Internal Testing Period (24 hours)**
   - Monitor for errors or performance issues
   - Collect feedback from internal users
   - Be prepared to disable feature if critical issues arise

### Phase 3: Gradual Rollout

1. **10% User Rollout**
   - Enable for 10% of users
   - Monitor for 24 hours
   - Key metrics to watch:
     - Error rates
     - API response times
     - Database performance

2. **50% User Rollout**
   - Increase to 50% if no issues at 10%
   - Continue monitoring for 24 hours
   - Review user feedback

3. **100% User Rollout**
   - Complete rollout to all users
   - Maintain heightened monitoring for 72 hours

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Monitoring Setup
- Implement all monitoring specified in the AutomationMonitoringPlan.md
- Configure alerts for critical metrics
- Set up dashboard for automation feature health

### User Communication
- Announce feature availability to all users
- Provide documentation on how to use automation settings
- Create FAQ for common questions
- Set up feedback channel for automation feature

### Maintenance Plan
- Schedule regular review of automation metrics (weekly for first month)
- Plan first optimization iteration based on initial usage data
- Schedule database cleanup job for expired automation settings
- Document operational procedures for support team

## Rollback Plan

### Triggers for Rollback
- Error rate exceeds 5% for automation endpoints
- Database performance degradation affects other features
- Critical security vulnerability discovered

### Rollback Process
1. **Disable Feature Flag**
   ```bash
   UPDATE feature_flags SET enabled = false WHERE feature_name = 'automation';
   ```

2. **Communicate to Users**
   - Send notification about temporary feature disablement
   - Provide estimated timeline for resolution

3. **Diagnose and Fix**
   - Analyze logs and metrics to identify root cause
   - Develop and test fix
   - Follow standard deployment process for fix

4. **Re-enable Gradually**
   - Follow Phase 3 process for re-enabling after fix

## Deployment Timeline

|------|----------|--------------|-------|
| Final code review | 1 day | Code complete | Tech Lead |
| Database migration prep | 1 day | Schema finalized | Database Admin |
| Configuration setup | 0.5 day | Environment defined | DevOps |
| Database migration | 1 hour | Migration script ready | Database Admin |
| API deployment | 2 hours | Database migration | DevOps |
| Internal testing | 24 hours | API deployment | QA Team |
| 10% rollout | 24 hours | Internal testing successful | Product Manager |
| 50% rollout | 24 hours | 10% phase successful | Product Manager |
| 100% rollout | 24 hours | 50% phase successful | Product Manager |
| Monitoring setup | 4 hours | API deployment | DevOps |
| User communication | 1 day | Feature fully deployed | Marketing |

## Success Criteria

The deployment will be considered successful when:

1. Feature is enabled for 100% of users for at least 72 hours
2. Error rate remains below 1% for automation endpoints
3. User adoption reaches at least 30% within first week
4. No P0/P1 bugs reported related to automation feature
5. System performance metrics remain within acceptable ranges
