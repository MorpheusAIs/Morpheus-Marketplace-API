# Morpheus API Automation Monitoring Plan

This document outlines the strategy for monitoring the automation feature in the Morpheus API Gateway post-deployment.

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### Performance Metrics

1. **Automated Session Creation Latency**
   - Average time to create an automated session
   - 95th and 99th percentile response times
   - Track separately for new vs. returning users

2. **API Endpoint Performance**
   - Response time for settings endpoint (GET/UPDATE)
   - Request rate and throughput
   - Error rates by endpoint

3. **System Resource Utilization**
   - CPU/memory usage with automation enabled vs. disabled
   - Database connection pool utilization
   - Database query performance for automation-related queries

### User Engagement Metrics

1. **Automation Adoption Rate**
   - Percentage of eligible users with automation enabled
   - Trend of enablement/disablement over time
   - Correlation with user activity levels

2. **Session Duration Settings**
   - Distribution of custom session durations
   - Most common duration settings
   - Changes in duration settings over time

3. **Automation Impact on User Activity**
   - API usage patterns for users with automation enabled vs. disabled
   - Completion request volume with automated sessions
   - User retention correlation with automation enablement

### Reliability Metrics

1. **Automated Session Success Rate**
   - Percentage of automated session creation attempts that succeed
   - Categorized failure reasons
   - Success rate by user segments

2. **Error Rates**
   - Authentication failures for automation endpoints
   - Session validation failures
   - Database errors related to automation settings

3. **System Stability**
   - Crash rate correlation with automation usage
   - Service restarts related to automation feature
   - Database connection issues

## Monitoring Dashboards

### Main Automation Dashboard

Create a dedicated dashboard with the following panels:

1. **Overview**
   - Automation feature status (enabled/disabled)
   - Total users with automation enabled
   - Total active automated sessions
   - Error rate summary

2. **Performance**
   - Session creation latency graphs (avg, p95, p99)
   - Settings endpoint response time
   - System resource usage correlation

3. **Usage**
   - Automation adoption rate over time
   - Session duration distribution
   - User activity with automation enabled/disabled

4. **Errors**
   - Error rate by category
   - Top failure reasons
   - Authentication failures

### Alerts Configuration

Set up the following alerts:

1. **Critical Alerts**
   - Automation session success rate drops below 95%
   - Settings endpoint error rate exceeds 5%
   - Significant increase in average session creation latency (>100ms)

2. **Warning Alerts**
   - Automation adoption rate decreases by >5% week-over-week
   - Unusual spike in automation disablement
   - Increase in authentication failures above baseline

3. **Operational Alerts**
   - Database query performance degradation for automation tables
   - Unusual pattern in session duration settings
   - High rate of system-wide automation being toggled

## Logging Strategy

Configure enhanced logging for automation-related operations:

1. **Log Levels**
   - INFO: Successful automation operations
   - WARN: Potential issues that don't affect functionality
   - ERROR: Failed operations that impact user experience

2. **Key Events to Log**
   - Automated session creation (success/failure)
   - User settings changes
   - System-wide feature flag changes
   - Session expiration events

3. **Log Format**
   - Include correlation IDs to trace requests
   - User ID (anonymized if needed)
   - Timestamp with millisecond precision
   - Operation context and result

## Health Checks

Implement the following health checks for the automation feature:

1. **Settings API Endpoint**
   - Regular probe to verify endpoint availability
   - Authentication verification
   - Response time measurement

2. **Session Creation**
   - Synthetic test to create automated sessions
   - Verification of correct session attributes
   - Test with various user configurations

3. **Database Health**
   - Connectivity to automation settings table
   - Query performance monitoring
   - Index usage optimization

## Regular Review Process

Establish a cadence for reviewing automation feature health:

1. **Daily Review**
   - Check critical metrics on dashboard
   - Review any triggered alerts
   - Verify feature availability

2. **Weekly Deep Dive**
   - Analyze performance trends
   - Review user adoption and feedback
   - Identify optimization opportunities

3. **Monthly Retrospective**
   - Comprehensive review of all metrics
   - Compare against baseline and targets
   - Plan improvements based on data

## Incident Response Plan

Define process for handling automation-related incidents:

1. **Incident Classification**
   - P0: Complete automation feature failure
   - P1: Degraded performance or partial functionality
   - P2: Minor issues affecting small user segments

2. **Response Steps**
   - Identification and triage process
   - Communication templates for different incident levels
   - Escalation paths based on severity

3. **Recovery Procedures**
   - Feature flag management for quick disablement
   - Database rollback procedures if necessary
   - Post-incident analysis template

## Documentation

Maintain up-to-date documentation for the monitoring system:

1. **Metric Definitions**
   - Clear explanation of each metric
   - Expected ranges and baselines
   - How to interpret deviations

2. **Dashboard Guide**
   - How to navigate and interpret dashboards
   - Custom filtering options
   - Exporting and reporting capabilities

3. **Troubleshooting Guides**
   - Common issues and their solutions
   - Diagnostic queries for investigation
   - Escalation procedures
