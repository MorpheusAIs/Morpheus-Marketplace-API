# Database Migration Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. Missing `user_automation_settings` table: The table was defined in models but not created in the database.
2. Missing `user_sessions` table: Similarly, this table was defined but not created in the database.

## Root Cause

- Alembic migrations were added but not applied to the production/development database.
- The current migration state was at `3ec3925c8904` when it should have been at `2025_04_20_0432` (head).
- Tests were passing likely because:
  - Test databases might be created and dropped for each test run
  - Database interactions might be mocked in tests
  - In-memory databases might be used for testing

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed the `user_automation_settings` table:

Created and applied `migration_fix.py` script that:
- Uses SQLAlchemy with raw SQL to create the table directly
- Creates appropriate indices
- Ensures compatibility with existing database schema

### 2. Fixed the `user_sessions` table:

Created and applied `session_table_fix.py` script that:
- Creates the `user_sessions` table with proper foreign key constraints
- Creates all required indices including the unique active session constraint

### 3. Updated Alembic migration state:

- Used `alembic stamp head` to mark migrations as completed
- This ensures future migrations will start from the correct state

## Preventing Future Issues

1. **During Development**:
   - Always run `alembic upgrade head` after pulling new code
   - Ensure migrations are tested in a staging environment before production

2. **In CI/CD**:
   - Add a step to verify all migrations are applied
   - Consider adding a database schema validation check

3. **For Production**:
   - Create a pre-deployment checklist that includes migration verification
   - Consider implementing automated migration checks before/after deployment

## Related Database Tables

1. `user_automation_settings`: Stores user-specific automation configuration
2. `user_sessions`: Manages user session information for API keys

## Additional Context

When datetime validation errors were encountered, we also fixed the API response model to correctly handle datetime objects.
